# LaTeXOldBooks

Collection of scientific old books digitised into LaTeX. 

In principle this project is fixated with books from the MIR Publisher. But any other book would do. The books digitised are inside each corresponding folder. The tex along with the figures are also included for compilation or customisation.

If you find any error or inconsistency, feel free to create an issue or a PR.

I do not posses neither any right nor commercial interest on this project.
